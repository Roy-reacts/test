This is a React functional component that displays a multi-step form for user sign-up. It imports several libraries, such as useState, useForm, yupResolver, and yup, which are used to manage form state, validate user input, and define the schema for the form.The component uses useState to manage the current step of the form and the form data. The useForm hook from the react-hook-form library is used to register form fields and manage form submission, and yupResolver is used to validate the form inputs based on the yup schema.The component defines a schema object that defines the required fields for the form, such as email, username, password, and contact details. The onSubmit function is called when the form is submitted, and it updates the form data and advances to the next step. If the final step is reached, the form data is saved to local storage.The component defines several helper functions, such as renderStepOne, renderStepTwo, renderStepThree, and renderStepFour, which render the form fields and buttons for each step of the form. The handlePrevClick function is called when the "Previous" button is clicked, and it moves back to the previous step of the form.Finally, the component renders the form based on the current step using a conditional rendering approach. The renderStepOne, renderStepTwo, renderStepThree, and renderStepFour functions are called conditionally based on the current step value.
